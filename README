# OS2025 - Home Assignment 1: Theme Color Customization in xv6

## Overview
This project extends the xv6 operating system to support dynamic theme changes, allowing users to customize the foreground and background colors of the entire screen. The functionality is implemented through an interactive table menu.

The task ensures that the new feature does not interfere with the normal operation or performance of the system.

## Features
- Display and hide a theme selection table using `ALT + T`.
- Navigate the table using:
  - `w` - move up
  - `s` - move down
- Choose from four predefined color combinations:
  1. Light Gray + Black (`lgr blk`)
  2. Magenta + White (`mgt WHT`)
  3. Red + Bright Cyan (`red CYN`)
  4. White + Yellow (`WHT YWL`)
- The currently selected item is highlighted (black text on green background).
- Last selected theme is remembered and pre-selected when reopening the menu.
- Table dynamically positions itself near the cursor based on available screen space.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd <repo-name>
